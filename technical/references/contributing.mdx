## Overview

ComfyStream is an open-source project maintained by the [Livepeer Community](https://www.livepeer.org/). We welcome contributions that improve the project's functionality,
performance, and user experience. We encourage developers to report any issues encountered during installation or usage.
Sharing these findings helps prevent others from encountering the same problems.

The Livepeer community values its developers and contributors. To recognize these efforts, we feature contributors through the
[Contributors Spotlight](https://contributors-spotlight.rickstaa.dev/). Additionally, our [Bounty Program](https://www.notion.so/livepeer/Livepeer-Bounty-Board-13b0a34856878041b9ddecaa1380b2e6)
offers rewards for contributions that enhance the project.
