After setting up ComfyStream and running your first workflow, you can use OBS Studio to capture and broadcast your AI-enhanced streams to different platforms through Livepeer.

## Prerequisites

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Install OBS Studio">
    Download and install [OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com/) for your operating system.
    
    OBS (Open Broadcaster Software) is a free and open-source software for video recording and live streaming.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Run ComfyStream Workflow">
    Before streaming with OBS, you need to have a running ComfyStream workflow. If you haven't done this yet, follow the [run your first workflow](/technical/get-started/quickstart#running-your-first-workflow) guide
     first.
    
    Once your stream is live, you'll see a small frame icon in the bottom right corner of the video output window.

    6. Set both Width and Height to **1024** to match the resolution of the ComfyStream video
    7. Click OK to add the source

## Troubleshooting

<Note>
If you experience performance issues, try reducing the resolution or frame rate in both ComfyStream and OBS settings. Browser sources can be resource-intensive, especially with AI-generated content.
