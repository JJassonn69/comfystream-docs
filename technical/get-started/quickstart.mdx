After you have successfully installed ComfyStream by following the [installation guide](install), you can run your first AI workflow.

## Prerequisites

### Download Example Workflows
There are example workflows in the GitHub repository [Comfystream](https://github.com/livepeer/comfystream/tree/main/workflows/comfystream). Download one to test your setup.

## Accessing ComfyStream UI

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="ComfyUI Preview Window">
    When you click the ComfyStream node and select **ComfyStream UI Preview** in ComfyUI, it will open a window that looks similar to the image below:
    ![comfystream-ui-dialog-box.png](../../images/comfystream-ui-dialog-box.png)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Standalone Browser Tab">
    If you prefer to run workflows in a new tab rather than inside ComfyUI, click **Open ComfyStream UI** from the [ComfyStream Menu](install#accessing-comfystream).
    This will open a similar dialog box in a new browser tab.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Note>
Opening the UI will ask for permission to access your video and audio so it can stream your webcam and microphone. You need to provide access to use ComfyStream.

## Running Your First Workflow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select your workflow">
    Click on **Choose files** and select the previously downloaded workflow from the [Comfystream repository](https://github.com/livepeer/comfystream/tree/main/workflows/comfystream).
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Start ComfyStream">
    Click on **Start Stream** to start the workflow. Once you start the stream, it will run the workflow in the background and you will see **Starting Stream..** at the bottom of the page.
    
    Depending on the workflow complexity, it may take some time to start the stream. Please wait patiently.

    Once the stream starts you will see the AI effects being applied in real-time.
